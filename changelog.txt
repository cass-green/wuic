##### v0.3.1 #####

Tracked issues:

##### v0.3.2 #####

Tracked issues: https://github.com/wuic/wuic/issues?labels=0.3.2&page=1&state=closed

Not tracked issues:
- ClasspathWuicResource not use java.class.path system's property anymore due to its limitations, use a new base path property instead.

Breaking changes:
- You need to explicitly import YUICompressor and EHCache in your pom.xml

##### v0.3.3 #####

Tracked issues: https://github.com/wuic/wuic/issues?labels=0.3.3&page=1&state=closed

Not tracked issues:
- Each time a steam's resource is retrieved, we look up for it, which increase the overhead. This look up is now done only one time when the resource is created.

Breaking changes:
- 'file' parameter not supported anymore in URL pattern, use this one instead: /[groupId]/[fileName]

##### v0.3.4 #####

Tracked issues: https://github.com/wuic/wuic/issues?labels=0.3.4&page=1&state=closed

Not tracked issues:
- More robust url builder to deal with some cases where configuration properties that are used to build some URLs don't contain "/"
- When YUICompressor is used, temporary file was created. Now everything is done in memory for better performances
- Resource path needed to ends with a supported file extension even if it was a regex. Test is now performed on physical resources and allows to indicates path like .*

Breaking changes:
- Disk resource (including webapp and classpath) completely reviewed including regex support. See wiki to see clear explanations about how it now works.
